# How to Make Pants Using a Simple Formula
 
If you want to make your own pants, you don't need to buy a complicated pattern or follow a long tutorial. You can use a simple formula to create pants that fit you well and suit your style. All you need is some fabric, a measuring tape, scissors, pins, a sewing machine, and some basic sewing skills. Here's how to make pants using a simple formula.
 
## Step 1: Measure yourself
 
The first step is to measure yourself to get the right dimensions for your pants. You will need to take six measurements: outside leg, inside leg, hip, thigh, ankle, and groin. Here's how to do it:

- **Outside leg.** Using a fabric measuring tape, stretch it from the start of the waist over outside of the hip to the ankle.
- **Inside leg.** Measure the inside of the leg. Stretch your tape from the groin to the ankle.
- **Hip.** Measure the circumference of your hips from the widest point.
- **Thigh.** Measure the circumference at the widest point of your thigh.
- **Ankle.** Measure the circumference of your ankle, making sure you can get your feet through that measurement.
- **Groin.** Measure the distance from the waist band in front (around your navel) to the waistband in back, following the line of your groin.

## Step 2: Calculate the fabric dimensions
 
The next step is to calculate the dimensions of the fabric you will need to cut for your pants. You can use this simple formula for any size and style of pants:

- **Length.** Add 4 cm (1.6 in) to your outside leg measurement. This will be the length of your fabric.
- **Width.** Multiply your hip measurement by 0.7 and add 4 cm (1.6 in). This will be the width of your fabric.
- **Crotch depth.** Divide your groin measurement by 2 and add 4 cm (1.6 in). This will be the depth of the crotch curve on your fabric.

For example, if your measurements are:

- Outside leg: 100 cm (39.4 in)
- Hip: 90 cm (35.4 in)
- Groin: 60 cm (23.6 in)

Then your fabric dimensions will be:

- Length: 104 cm (40.9 in)
- Width: 67 cm (26.4 in)
- Crotch depth: 34 cm (13.4 in)

## Step 3: Cut and pin the fabric
 
The third step is to cut and pin the fabric according to your calculations. You will need two pieces of fabric of equal size for each leg of your pants. Here's how to do it:

1. Fold your fabric in half lengthwise with the right sides facing each other.
2. Cut along the fold to get two pieces of fabric.
3. Fold each piece of fabric in half widthwise with the right sides facing each other.
4. Cut a curve on one corner of each piece of fabric according to your crotch depth measurement. The curve should start from the top edge and end at the side edge of the fabric.
5. Pin along the curved edges of each piece of fabric with right sides facing each other. These will be the crotch seams of your pants.

## Step 4: Sew and finish the pants
  
The final step is to sew and finish your pants using a sewing machine and some basic sewing techniques. Here's how to do it:

1. Sew along the pinned edges of each piece of fabric with a straight stitch and a 1 cm (0.4 in) seam allowance. These are the crotch seams of your pants.
